// Prototypes are templates/blueprints that all JS objects inherit methods and properties from
// So, for example, the Array prototype has a select number of methods and properties that every
// array you create will inherit
// Every array, for example, will have a __proto__ property, which is a direct link to this prototype
// object, meaning it has acccess to all the inherited properties and methods
