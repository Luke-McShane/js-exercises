  <!-- The origin of the SVG is at the top-left of the element -->
  <svg height="200" width="200">
    <!-- The cx represents where on the x-axis the center point will be
         The cy represents where on the y-axis the center point will be
         The r represents the radius of the circle
         We can have as many shape elements within the SVG as we wish, but
         if any elements go outside the bounds of the SVG, these parts will be clipped
         We also have stroke, stroke-width, and fill properties.
         The stroke refers to the border of the circle, whereas the fill refers to the
         inside of the circle.
         These properties are set to colours, while the stroke-width is a number 
         We can set the fill to 'transparent', allowing us to have elements be placed
         within the circle and still be visible
        
         The 'stroke-dasharray' property refers to how long each dash will be, and how
         many pixels there will be between each dash.
         We can pass in another value, so the first will be the dash length, the second
         the units of spacing between each dash
        
        Because the perimeter of the circle is pi x r x 2, we can make it so the dash length
        is the entire perimeter, and slowly decrease this value so we can have border that
        appears to decrease in size
      
        The SVG border always starts on the right-hand side, and works its way around clockwise 
      
        The 'dash-offset' property represents how much the array dash will be shifted/offset 
        This allows. It defines how far along the SVG path a dash will begin. So if we set it
        to the size of the dash, then we will displace the start by a full dash 
      
        We can make the dashoffset negative so the offset goes clockwise
        We can also add a transform so the offset begins at the top of the circle, rather than
        at the right-hand side.
        The rotate takes 3 arguments: The first is the amount of degrees, and the second two
        determine the x and y coords, respectively, at where will be the centerpoint of the rotation
